What is an OO adapter?
Something that takes an interface and adapts it to the one
that the client is expecting.

How does the client use the adapter?
The client makes a call to the "target" interface.
The adapter implements this target interface and
translates the request for the adaptee interface.

Client -> The one making the request
Adapter -> It implements the requested interface and translates the request to the other interface
Adaptee -> The interface being adapted for. Ex: TurkeyAdapter implements Duck (expected by client)
           and converts Duck method calls to Turkey Calls.

Adapter Pattern Definition:
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class
into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that could not otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

The Adapter pattern helps decouple the client from the actual interface.
