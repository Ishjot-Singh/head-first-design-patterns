State Pattern Definition:
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior
when its internal state changes. The object will appear to
change its class

The class diagrams for the State and Strategy pattern are the same.
They differ in their intent.
With the State Pattern, we have a set of behaviors encapsulated in
state objects; at any time the context is delegating to one of those
states.
With Strategy, the client usually specifies the strategy object that
the context is composed with.
