Composite Pattern Definition:
The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.

The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures
of objects in the form of trees that contain both
compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes.

Using a composite structure, we can apply the same
operations over both composites and individual
objects.

A composite contains components.
Components come in two flavors:
composites and leaf elements.
A composite holds a set
of children, those children may be other
composites or leaf elements.
