The Command Pattern allows you to decouple the requester of an action
from the object that actually performs the action

Command Pattern Definition:
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an
object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.

The Meta Command Pattern allows you to create
macros of commands so that you can execute multiple commands
at once.
