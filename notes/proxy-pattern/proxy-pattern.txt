Proxy Pattern ("Controlling Object Access") Definition:
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or
placeholder for another object to control access to it.


Proxies are used to control and manage access.

A remote proxy acts as a local representative to a remote object.

Q. What’s a “remote object?”
A. It’s an object that lives in the heap of a different Java Virtual Machine
   (or more generally, a remote object that is running in a different address space).

Q. What’s a “local representative?”
A. It’s an object that you can call local methods on
   and have them forwarded on to the remote object.

Q. How does the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) help?

A. RMI gives us a way to find objects in a remote JVM and allows us to invoke their
   methods.
