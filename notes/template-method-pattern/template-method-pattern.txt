Template Method Pattern Definition:
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithm’s structure.

The Template Method defines the steps of an algorithm and allows
subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps

The Template Method Pattern maximizes reuse among the
subclasses.

We often provide a "hook" in the template method.
A hook is a method that is declared in the
abstract class, but only given an empty
or default implementation. This gives
subclasses the ability to “hook into” the
algorithm at various points, if they wish; a
subclass is also free to ignore the hook.
