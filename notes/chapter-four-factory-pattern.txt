Factories handle the details of object creation.

Factory Pattern Definition:
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

Method in the interface used for creating objects is called
the "Factory Method".

Players of the Factory Pattern:
1. Creators:
Classes that produce products are called concrete creators.
These concrete creators extend an abstract creator class.
These subclasses are tasked with producing the actual "products"

2. Products:
The factories produce "Products". For example, in our case - the product
is Pizza.
The product class is again subclasses by "Concrete Products". In our example
the Concrete Products are the different kinds of Pizzas like NYCheesePizza.

Advantages of the Factory Pattern:
Avoids duplication in the code
Provides one place to perform maintenance.
Clients depend only upon interfaces to instantiate objects

Factory pattern is one of the most powerful techniques for
adhering to the DI principle as it makes the code
rely on abstractions rather than on concrete classes.
