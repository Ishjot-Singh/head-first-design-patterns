Q. What is a Pattern?

A. A Pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.

Q. What is an Anti-Pattern?

A. An Anti-Pattern tells you how to go from a problem
   to a BAD solution


The context is the situation in which the pattern applies. This
should be a recurring situation.

The problem refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this
context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the
context.

The solution is what youâ€™re after: a general design that anyone
can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints.
