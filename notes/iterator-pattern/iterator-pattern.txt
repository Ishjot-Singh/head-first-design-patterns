Iterator Pattern Definition:
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

The Iterator Pattern relies on an interface called Iterator.
Iterator interface usually contains two methods; next() and hasNext().
The hasNext() method tells us if there are
more elements in the aggregate to iterate
through.
And The next() method returns the next object in the aggregate.
