Implementing the Open to extension and Closed to modification principle helps create
designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new
functionality to meet changing requirements

Decorator pattern helps us implement the Open-Closed principle

As the Open-Closed principle adds abstraction and complexity to our application
we should only concentrate on implementing it in places that are likely to change.

Decorator Pattern definition:
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality
