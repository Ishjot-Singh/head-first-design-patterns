1st Design Principle
Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
i.e, take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t.

2nd Design Principle
Program to an interface, not an implementation.

3rd Design Principle
Favor composition over inheritance.



===========================

Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.
