Publishers (Subjects) + Subscribers (Observers) = Observer Pattern
Observers are the clients who will be notified of any changes in the subject.
Ex: Subject is an int variable. Whenever this variable changes, its observers (subscribers) will be notified of the change.


Observer Pattern Definition:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically

The Observer Pattern provides an object design where
subjects and observers are loosely coupled.
